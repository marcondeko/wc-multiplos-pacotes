Split up the items in your customer's cart to offer multiple shipping method selections for a single order

== Description ==

Take advantage of a new feature presented in WooCommerce 2.1 and split your cart into packages to offer your users 
multiple shipping selections. Packages can be broken down based on shipping classes or on a per product basis. Each
group will have its own shipping selection under the shipping section of your cart and checkout forms.

In addition, this plugin can limit which shipping methods are used for each package. Using the provided table, match
each shipping class to its applicable method, or leave it blank to include them all!

This plugin is designed as a simplistic UI for users who want to separate their cart in packages without the need
of a developer. The actual functionality of multiple shipping options is provided through WooCommerce 2.1

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happened to the item details for each shipping method after an order is placed? =

This is a WooCommerce design choice. In the cart and checkout fields, each shipping option lists the products below that apply to the given rate.
After submitted, the receipt and order page will only list the options selected, and not which items should be shipped that way. If you would like
to request this feature, please contact WooCommerce support.
